# FLOP (Flexible Load Optimizing Proxy)
FLOP is a personal project I am working on as an introduction to web traffic management. My main goal is to better familiarize myself with these concepts and gain a deeper understanding of Java's capabilities. I will be working on this in my freetime and providing a development log on my blog, Mechanical Inclination.
